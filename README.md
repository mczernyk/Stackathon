What can we learn from watching whales? **MEXTRIX** provides a visualization of **[Bitmex](https://www.bitmex.com/register/dlOCfE)** Orderbook data in real time as well as notifications for trades greater than **_100,000 contracts_** and liquidations.

_What does it all mean?_

That is for you to decide.
